 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

This project's scope is to analyse Ocean Laboratory as a comanagement partnership between Samsung and the Production Engineering Department of Polytechnic School of USP. Semi-structured interviews with the main points of contact of each \textit{stakeholder} of the laboratory were made, aside from a content analysis of 5280 answers of qualitative questionaries applied in the last 2 years. From the analysis', exploration, improvement and mitigation points were identified for future development. The results achieved within this work act as a starting point for projects to be developed by Ocean's comanagement, working together to achieve the laboratory's best use.
